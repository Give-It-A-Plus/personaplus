# PersonaPlus
Give yourself a plus!

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

> [!NOTE]
> **TL;DR**: PersonaPlus' old source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/personaplus), I am rewritting the app and it's new source code will live under this organisation.

In this repository I will host the new version of **PersonaPlus**, the selfcare app to give yourself a plus! The original source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/personaplus). I wanted to start some refactorings and ended up rewriting the app from scratch, and while at first I was just goint to make a new branch at the repo, since I was starting over and going to mess up the repo's Git history, I've decided to fresh start with a new repo - under an organisation!

Who knows? Maybe in the future another -Plus apps is born? Future's uncertain, indeed.

Anyway, thanks for checking in! I'll be "inactive" for a few weeks - that means fully active but not syncing my changes. I want the new version to be bulk uploaded in here.

Until then,
Cya!
